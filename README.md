# BLUESPAWN

[![BLUESPAWN client build](https://github.com/ION28/BLUESPAWN/workflows/BLUESPAWN%20client%20build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ION28/BLUESPAWN/actions) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ION28/BLUESPAWN?include_prereleases) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/ION28/BLUESPAWN)

## Our Mission
BLUESPAWN helps blue teams monitor Windows systems in real-time against active attackers by detecting anomalous activity

## What is BLUESPAWN
BLUESPAWN is an **active defense** and **endpoint detection and response tool** which means it can be used by defenders to quickly **detect**, **identify**, and **eliminate** malicious activity and malware across a network.

## Why we made BLUESPAWN
We've created and open-sourced this for a number of reasons which include the following:
* **Move Faster**: We wanted tooling specifically designed to quickly identify malicious activity on a system
* **Know our Coverage**: We wanted to know exactly what our tools could detect and not rely on blackbox software as much (ie AV programs). This approach will help us to better focus our efforts on specific lines of effort and have confidence in the status of others.
* **Better Understanding**: We wanted to better understand the Windows attack surface in order to defend it better
* **More Open-Source Blue Team Software**: While there are many open-source Red Team Tools out there, the vast majority of some of the best Blue Team tools are closed-source (ie, AVs, EDRs, SysInternals, etc). We shouldn't need to rely on security through obscurity to prevent malicious actors (obviously very difficult, but something to strive for!)
* **Demonstrate Features of Windows API**: We combed through a ton of Microsoft Documentation, StackOverflow Answers, and more to create this. Hopefully others may find some of the code useful.

## Try out BLUESPAWN 
> Note: BLUESPAWN is under active *alpha* development, so many features may not work as expected yet and detections may be too narrow scope or generate lots of false positives.
1. Download the latest release from [this page](https://github.com/ION28/BLUESPAWN/releases)
2. Open an Administrative Command Prompt
3. Run the following command to see the available options
```cmd
.\BLUESPAWN.exe --help
```
4. Run the following from an Administrative Powershell Prompt to trigger *T1004 - Winlogon Helper DLL*
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\" "Shell" "explorer.exe, #{binary_to_execute}" -Force
```
5. Run BLUESPAWN from the Administrative Command Prompt
```cmd
.\BLUESPAWN.exe --hunt -l Cursory
```
6. Restore the correct Winlogon Shell value via Powershell
```powershell
Set-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\" "Shell" "explorer.exe" -Force
```

## Lines of Effort
BLUESPAWN consists of 3 major modes as listed below. Several of these modules have submodules (which may not be created in the codebase yet) as listed below and all are in varying stages of planning, research, and development. Additionally, they are supported by a number of other modules.
* **Hunt** (Hunts for evidence of malicious behavior)
* **Mitigate** (Mitigates vulnerabilities by applying security settings)
* **Monitor** (Continuously monitors the system for potentially malicious behavior)
* **User** (Contains program main, IOBase, and other similar functions)
* **Util** (Contains a collection of modules that support core operations)
    * Configurations
    * Event Logs
    * File System
    * Log
    * PEs
    * Processes

## Special Thanks
We would like to provide a special thank you to the following projects that have helped us to build BLUESPAWN:
* Microsoft's documentation and examples on the Windows API
* The [MITRE's ATT&CK Project](https://attack.mitre.org/) which has put together an amazing framework for which to consider, document, and categorize attacker tradercraft
* Red Canary's [Atomic Red Team Project](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) which has been incredibly useful in helping to test the detections we are building
* [@op7ic](https://github.com/op7ic)'s [EDR-Testing-Script](https://github.com/op7ic/EDR-Testing-Script) Project
* The Japan Computer Emergency Response Team (JPCERT)'s [Tool Analysis Result Sheet](https://jpcertcc.github.io/ToolAnalysisResultSheet/) for its documentation of attacker behavior and correlation with detection opportunities
