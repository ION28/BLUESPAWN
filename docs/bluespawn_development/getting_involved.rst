Getting Involved
================

Want to help make BLUESPAWN even more effective at locating and stopping malware? Join us on `the BLUESPAWN Discord Server <https://discord.gg/JMxPPfZ>`_ and help with development or even just suggest a feature or report a bug. No experience required - there's no better way to learn about development or security than by just jumping right in!

If you'd like to help contribute code, you can get started by checking out our wiki page on `setting up your development environment <https://github.com/ION28/BLUESPAWN/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment>`_. Please feel free to reach out to us in Discord if you run into any problems getting set up! We generally track bugs and new features through Issues and coordinate in chat when doing any development work.
